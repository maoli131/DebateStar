for,"I’ll speak for the motion that “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” Perhaps a natural reaction to that would be, what, are there still people who think it’s more important to save money, than to save the world? That’s not our point. Our point is, that we should really save the world, not just feel like we’re saving it. Let’s be clear—global warming is real. Man-made, and increases by carbon emissions. And global warming will harm future generations, especially the world’s poor. But the brutal fact is, that even major carbon cuts at dramatic cost will make little impact on temperature, and do virtually nothing to help the world. Still, my honored opponents will spend hundreds or even thousands of billions of dollars, to slightly reduce the impact of climate change 100 years from now, yet more than half the world’s population suffers from Medieval problems that we could fix right now, at much lower cost. This is nothing less than a moral tragedy for the developed world. Knowingly squandering colossal sums of money, achieving almost nothing, while fractional sums could save millions of lives right now. Obvious as it may sound, our goal isn’t for those of us in wealthy western world to feel good about ourselves, presumably, it’s about making sure we do the most good. Today, 1 billion lack clean drinking water, 2 billion people lack sanitation, 3 billion people lack simple micronutrients, preventing physical and mental development. One quarter of all the world’s deaths, are due to easily curable infectious diseases. The equivalent of the population of Florida, wiped off the map, each year. As an example, 1 million people die from malaria each year, and up to 2 billion people get the debilitating disease. Yet, my esteemed opponents will focus on how global warming will cause a slight increase in malaria increase 100 years from now, and suggest that we should fix that through inefficient carbon cuts. But we could eradicate malaria right now, if we wanted, and at a lot lower cost. That is the moral choice. This pattern of little good at high cost, we find repeated in the cases by opponents will present to you. And this is why all peer-reviewed economic valises show that simply cutting carbon is a poor way to help the world. And that’s exactly the crux of tonight’s debate. That the best available economic evidence tells us that by focusing on cutting carbon emissions, we’re committing to an exceptionally inefficient way to tackle the symptoms of global warming, let alone global warming itself. And given how much of our resources will be squandered in the process, the consequences are nothing less than a moral tragedy. Of course, my esteemed opponents will claim that without major carbon cuts, the world will be beyond saving. Oliver Tickell has written that unabated global warming by the end of the century will be a catastrophe, and the beginning of the extinction of the human race because all the ice will melt and we’ll see 200 feet of sea-level rise in the long term, wiping out pretty much everyone we hold dear, killing billions of people. This doom-mongering is simply wrong. It’s inconsistent with everything we know. And it’s important that people everywhere start to realize this. We’ve entrusted the UN Climate Panel, the so-called IPCC, with its thousands of scientists, to outline the most likely climate consequences. They do not support Tickell, or any of the other, more alarmist writings of recent times. What the IPCC does tell us is, yes, sea levels will rise, somewhere between six and 24 inches over the coming century. Such a rise is entirely manageable, and not dissimilar to the about 12 inches we barely noticed, have risen over the last 150 years. Dramatic, expensive carbon cuts would make sea-level rise just a few inches less in 100 years. Is this really the best we can do to help the world? Of course, the obvious and easy thing to say is, well, we should do all good things, we should both make major carbon reductions, and combat malaria. But this simply ignores the fact that we aren’t doing either very well. We avoid the hard truth that the rich world’s focus is shifting daily towards global warming, with proportional less support seen for the real, and more tractable problems. It’s simply untruthful to claim that the focus on climate change doesn’t mean there’s less money going elsewhere. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, is telling us that billions of dollars are being redirected to the fight, global warming, at the expense of the biggest killers of the poor countries. Any company or organization today that wants to be responsible, even just cool, will not be spending their cash on fighting tuberculosis, but wants to go carbon-neutral. We must save the world, yes. And here’s how. At The Copenhagen Consensus Project last year, a panel of the world’s most distinguished economists looked at a wealth of research of all the major problems in the world, and the possible solutions to them. And they showed us where we can do the most good. They agreed that global warming’s real, and they were unanimous that the best way to tackle it is by investing much more in research and development in low carbon energy technologies. The economists also found that carbon emission cuts, tonight’s motion, would be the poorest use of our money. They confirmed that we can do so much more good elsewhere, that we need to ease our preoccupation with cutting carbon, and focusing much more on fixing the real problems of the here and now. This is about saving everyone’s world. Not through ineffective and hugely costly carbon cuts, but through effective research and development, and low carbon energy sources, that anyway, will be the only long-term solution to the CO2 problem. And then remembering the major problems and challenges of this world. Every single year and right now, a devastation is taking place in our world. A dumb, readily avoidable devastation. Continuing mindlessly, and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon cuts, is simply disgraceful, when it takes so little to do something about this devastation. So, this is our chance. Our chance not just to feel good about helping the planet, but actually to do the right thing, the rational thing, and the morally correct thing. I commend this motion to you, do what’s rational, not just what’s fashionable. Thank you.",
against,"would prefer not to see this as any kind of feud, I think it’s a debate and it’s a debate which I’m very pleased to be able to pursue here, with all of you. Bjorn did an excellent presentation, and he made very effective use of the particular rhetorical flourish which I would call the false choice, or the false dichotomy. Either we address the problem of global warming, or we address the problems of malaria, water provision, and malnutrition. But this is a false choice, no one’s saying that we’ve got to do one or other, we can do both. It is no more real a choice than that between tackling global warming and eating pizza. You know, we can do both. In fact, if we tackle the problems of global warming in an effective way, it will directly help with the provision of water. One of the major problems of global warming is the loss of rainfall, shifting patterns of rainfall, melting of glaciers that feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide. So, failing to deal with global warming is a huge step back on that fight, likewise with malaria, and other insect-borne disease, as temperatures rise, so these diseases will spread and become more prevalent, and hold back development further. Now. The core point though, Bjorn very kindly began to make it for me. It is that the consequences of not dealing with global warming are potentially catastrophic. And, he said this is inconsistent with everything we know. Well, that’s wrong. What we do know, is that 55 million years ago, at a time called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, temperatures were ten degrees warmer than they are now. Carbon dioxide levels were approximately one thousand parts a million -- very high levels. And sea levels were approximately two hundred and fifty feet higher. Now, we have been there before. We can go there again. There is no law that says that we cannot revert to that state of fifty-five million years ago. There is no certainty that that will happen. It might happen or it might not. Climate is extremely complex. There are many, many feedbacks of frankly, breathtaking intricacy and complexity, which we haven’t even begun to fathom. And for that reason, I find Bjorn’s certainty that this will not take place completely incomprehensible. There is no certainty in this. The only certainty is once it’s already happened. And given those uncertainties, our overwhelming priority must be to make sure that it does not happen. It is hard even to put a probability on it, but the facts are that climate, the climate system is characterized by feedbacks, including some very powerful positive feedbacks, even with the one degree. In fact, under one degree of temperature rise that we’ve had so far, these feedbacks are kicking into effect. These include the melting of arctic sea ice which causes the sun’s rays to be absorbed, raising temperatures at the poles. It includes the reduced absorption of carbon dioxide into oceans. There were results in the newspaper yesterday from the Sea of Japan where the absorption of carbon dioxide is halved. We see that the forests of Canada, which had been considered a major net carbon sink, are now becoming a net source of carbon as a result of insect depredations caused by higher temperatures. So, positive feedback process are already taking place as temperatures continue to rise further. Further positive feedbacks can swing into effect and we could indeed find ourselves propelled through the uncontrolled emissions of methane, from example, from peat bogs and swamps. We could find that we well and truly lose control of climate, that positive feedbacks take over from everything that we are doing ourselves. And that is where we must not go. And yes, there are costs. To avoid this you have to spend money. But there are many other cases in which we spend money to avoid potentially catastrophic risks, even if we perceive those risks as being improbable – such as insurance against a car crash or a house fire, where the costs are potentially huge, even if the probability is low. In this particular case, of course, we have to be mindful of the cost. We don’t just want to throw unlimited amounts of money at this problem. But if we look at the amounts of money, I mean, my cost – and which includes not only mitigation but also substantial funding for adaptation, which is already taking place – is about one trillion dollars per year. And that is, roughly the same as what the world spends on weaponry and the military sector. So if we can afford to spend that on weapons, why can’t we afford to spend it to prevent this potentially ruinous catastrophe that could come upon us. But I will go a stage further. I will say that much of this isn’t really cost at all. It is investment. Because we need ultimately to move away from fossil fuels anyway. If we move away from fossil fuels sooner, before we have to – because they run out – that actually saves enormous economic cost. It saves the economic cost of a hundred and fifty dollar a barrel petrol, oil. And that is something that has caused America and other countries huge hardships. We can create new industries. We have huge idle work forces. We have huge idle productive capacity in industries that can be put back to work building us a future free of fossil fuels. The world at the moment is ravaged by conflict, much of that conflict over access to fossil fuels. If we move to a fossil fuel-free future, then much of that expenditure will vanish. But not only that expenditure, but all of the suffering, all of the tragedy that is associated with it. So in answer to the question, the motion, Is it worth the money to make these major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions?, the only possible answer is, Yes, and do it now.",
for,"Well, while he was running, Barack Obama was heard to say that he would bankrupt our coal industry. Now, I don’t doubt Washington’s ability to bankrupt almost anything in the United States. But, but China is currently adding a hundred gigs of coal electricity a year. That’s one entire United States worth of coal consumption every three years. There is no end in sight and there are other countries, all across the globe, following exactly in its footsteps. So let me say here quickly, where I end up and then try and tell you how I get there. We rich people of the planet can’t stop the other five billion poor people from burning a couple of trillion tons of carbon that they have within easy reach. We can’t even make any real dent in global emissions because the emissions are growing too fast, they involve too much involvement by very poor people who can’t easily change their ways and because those poor people are part of the same global economy as us.And if we are foolish enough, which we could well be, we will let carbon worries send our jobs to their shores and they will grow even faster and carbon emissions will grow faster still. It should go without saying, we don’t control global supply of carbon. Ten countries ruled by thoroughly nasty people control eighty per cent of the world’s oil, a trillion barrels currently worth fifty trillion dollars at current market prices. Now, if I told you that there was that value in gold where it actually is, where the oil actually is, you would scoff at any suggestion that anything we could do, no matter what we spent, could force those people to keep that oil in the ground. It’s all they’ve got. They will drill it. They will pump it. They will find a market and somebody will burn it. Poor countries all around this planet are sitting on a trillion tons of readily accessible coal. It’s all they’ve got for energy beyond the other great carbon reservoir of the planet, which is the rain forests and the soils, which they also, by and large, control. They will squeeze the carbon they can out of cheap coal, cheap forests and cheap soil, because that’s what’s there, unless they can get something even cheaper than that. And that, as I shall discuss shortly, is going to take some doing. We no longer control demand for carbon, either. The five billion poor people are already the main problem – not us. If you have heard otherwise, you have heard wrong. Collectively, the poor already emit twenty per cent more greenhouse gas than we do. We burn a lot more carbon individually, of course, but they have a lot more children. Their fecundity has beaten out our gluttony and the gap is now widening very fast. China, not the United States, is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gas on the planet and it will soon be joined by others. It’s only a matter of time. And finally, the poor countries have made perfectly clear that they are not interested at all in spending what a low carb diet would cost. They have more pressing problems. So it really does come down to this. First, can we give the world something cheaper than carbon? The moon shot law of economics says, Why, yes, we can. If we just really put our minds to it, it will happen -- atom bomb, moon landing, energy, you name it. No, not this time. Fossil fuels are very cheap because they concentrate a lot of energy in a small space. You find a mountain of coal and you can just shovel gargantuan amounts of energy into the boxcars. Renewable fuels like sun and wind are much harder. Windmills are now fifty story skyscrapers, yet one windmill generates a piddling two megawatts. A jumbo needs a hundred megawatts to get off the ground. Google is building hundred megawatt servers just to move bits around. Meeting New York City’s total energy demand would require something like thirteen thousand windmills spinning at full speed or more like fifty thousand windmills scattered all over the state because you’ve gotta have enough of them to be sure enough of them are in the windy spots. What was your Mayor thinking when he suggested that you might just tuck them into Manhattan? I mean, that kind of thinking betrays a very common view that, In fact, it betrays a profound ignorance about how difficult it is to get huge amounts of energy out of these very dilute, thin forms of fuel, like sun and wind. Renewable technologies are not moving down the same plummeting cost curves that we’ve seen in our laptops and our cell phones. When you replace conventional with renewable everything gets bigger, not smaller – much, much bigger – and costs get higher, not lower. China and India won’t trade three cent coal for fifteen cent wind or thirty cent solar. And if we force those expensive technologies on ourselves, we will certainly end up doing more harm than good. Twenty percent of the planet buys much less carbon, the other eighty percent will be delighted to buy at a lower price. The real jobs will go where the energy is cheap, just as they go where the labor is cheap because manufacturing and heavy industry require so much energy. And in a global economy you can’t possibly compete if you’re paying two or three times as much as your competitors for an essential input. Green jobs means Americans paying other Americans to chase carbon while the rest of the world builds power plants and factories. But the rest of the world is less efficient than us and less careful. A massive transfer of carbon and industry and jobs from us to them will raise carbon emissions. It will not lower them. So, unless we are going to ask the Pentagon to take charge – and good luck with that -- we don’t have the power to deliver any lasting reduction in global carbon emissions at all. Whatever we might achieve in the very short term at home, we can’t control the global supply of carbon. We can’t control the five billion poor people who desperately want to burn it and who already control more of the demand than we do. And we can’t control the flight of jobs and industry to where the industry is cheap. Frantically chasing the impossible and falling flat on your face doesn’t make things better. It often makes things worse and it’s never worth the money.",
against,"Major carbon reductions are worth the money. Mr. Huber, I want to thank you for your novel argument, summed as, No, we can’t. You begin by saying you care about the world’s poor and then you start by saying, “The five billion poor people are the problem.” We’re going to send our jobs to their shores. They have too many children. This type of contempt will not lead us towards the world that we want to build for our kids, either here or across the world. The question at hand, and the question we face, is, Are major reductions in carbon worth the money? And I’ll very simply give examples at the level of the economy, at the level of a corporation and the level of the individual. Not is it all investments, every investment – it’s, Are major reductions worth the money? Mr. Huber, I read that you wrote about enhancing America’s electric power grid. That’s a great way of having great reductions in carbon in a way that’s very much worth the money. We waste about six to ten percent of all energy through America’s very inefficient electricity grid. If we invested in a smart grid it could save up to twenty billion dollars a year that’s lost through line loss. Major carbon reductions can be worth the money. Americans spend about a week a year, if they commute a lot, stuck in their cars. That costs the economy in terms of productivity and fuel costs about $78 billion a year. If we invested in new traffic software and signaling, public transportation to create those green jobs that you have such contempt for, um, we could in fact reduce that, greatly. Major carbon reductions are worth the money. At the level of a corporation, more and more corporations are not just doing it because it’s fashionable, they’re doing it because they’re building a strategy for sustainability to move them forward. I’ll give you a few examples. Xerox, that iconic American company, around the year 2000 was on the verge of bankruptcy, was, was at its knees, and the vultures were circling. And Ann Mulcahy, the CEO, when she took over she committed that by 2012 they would reduce their carbon output by 10 percent between 2002 and 2012, and they started investing in remanufacturing, and today 91 percent of all the parts in Xerox machines are remanufactured or recycled, which means you don’t need to get new stuff from the earth and much better from a carbon emissions standpoint. Well by the year 2006, they reached that 2012 goal, they reached their 10 percent reduction and they actually committed to a 25 percent reduction, by the year 2012. Today, in 2009, they’re at about 21 percent and they’re well on their way. There’s a company that’s more productive, that’s making more money for its shareholders, because of strict carbon restrictions. Sun Microsystems has about half of its workers telecommuting. This saves the worker a few hundred dollars, up to $1000 because they don’t have to commute anymore, and it saves the company money. Last year about $68 million in avoided costs because they didn’t have offices for all those people. People get to be more productive, they get to work in their pajamas, it’s a win-win all over the place, major reductions in their carbon use, about 30,000 metric tons saved by that, are good and worth the money. Finally a company that I do work with, Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart made three commitments in its turn-around, one, to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy which would be a major reduction in carbon. Two, to produce zero waste, which would reduce their carbon emissions. And three, to only sell green products in their stores. Major commitments by a major manufacturer. They’ve pushed this down the supply chain, it pulled energy out, lowering the cost of the products, lowering the cost to the consumer. And one of the reasons a company like Wal-Mart is doing so well right now is that they’ve become more efficient, because of a focus on major reductions in carbon. And, one of the associates I was able to work with at Wal-Mart is named Chuck Bonnett, I want to give you as an example—at an individual level, how major reductions can actually make sense. Chuck works the meat counter at Wal-Mart, and he made a personal sustainability practice commitment, to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that he had personally. A major reduction in his personal life, in carbon emissions. And he tried to figure out what to do and he was actually in line at a fast food restaurant. And as he was in this line waiting for his burger, he watched all the cars idling and thought, oh, that’s carbon. And he thought about the hamburger which had been, been frozen and shipped across, maybe across the country, perhaps across the world, and he thought about the carbon that came from the cow and the thought about the plastic that was wrapping this hamburger. And he thought you know if I cut that out, it’s not gonna only be good for my health, and he had to lose about 100 pounds, maybe I can get a discount on my health care, and actually, maybe I can save some money ‘cause I’ll cook meals at home rather than going out so much which a lot of people across the world are doing, who have the opportunity to eat out. In this case, major reductions in his own personal carbon emissions, were worth the money. Now… our opponents tend to focus on the fact that we can’t do everything. And that there are other problems and, yes, there are other problems and we need to work on them. For example, I could tell you tonight, that there are exit signs at the back of the theater and, there’s one at the side of theater and that’s probably very important in case there were a fire, but, maybe I could instead tell you about influenza, because that’s the eighth-largest killer in America and I might tell you worry about the person next to you, ‘cause they might be a little sickly. And you might need to worry about them, or maybe I could check your purses, or check your dinner reservation for later tonight because maybe, you’ll decide to go out and have a dessert or a creamy special appetizer. Because you know that heart disease is the greatest killer in America. These things are all true, but we can do two things at once, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And the great thing about carbon, is that it’s one single thread, if you pull it, the entire sweater begins to unravel. It’s one single step that can help people save money and live better lives at their individual level, at a corporate level, and even at an economy-wide level. Major reductions in carbon are good for the economy, and are absolutely worth the money. Thank you.",
for,"Thank you, John. Adam and colleagues, I really wish I could believe that we can manage the costs that would control climate. Very sadly, I have to quote Samuel Johnson, the great British lexicographer. “An obstinate stubbornness, a rationality, stops me believing it.” And with a twinkle in my eye, because we’re in New York and near Wall Street, what I want to show, very dangerously, is that, climate science and these costs are sub-prime science…sub-prime economics, and above all, sub-prime politics. And they will cost us dear, despite what Adam and Oliver and Hunter will be saying. And we’ve got to be very, very careful. And Bjorn used a very important phrase. Let’s not just follow what’s fashionable. In fact, Johnson again had a wonderful phrase for it. “Let’s not be befuddled, by the clamor of the times.” Let me therefore start, by science, I’m not going to say much on science because, I agree with what Robert said, right at the start in this. It’s actually not very much about the science, it’s always been about economic and political choice. Everything is when it comes down to it, like it or not. But I just want you to have one image, and it’s a very serious scientific image, I want you to think of the world…I want you to think of the world from inner Siberia, to Greenland, then to Singapore, and then come to the Arab states and to Sahara. What, ladies and gentlemen, is the temperature range I have just covered. It is from minus 20 degrees C, to nearly 50 degrees C, a range of 70 degrees C, in which humanity has adapted and learnt to live. We are talking about, ignoring the extremes that Oliver said, a prediction of 2 to 3 degrees C, what a funk! I’m very serious, what a funk! Humanity lives successfully from Greenland to Singapore to Saudi Arabia. 70 degrees C. And what is more, the carbon reductions will not produce an outcome that is predictable. Climate is the most complex, coupled, non-linear, chaotic system known to man. Of course there are human influences in it, nobody denies that. But what outcome will they get, by fiddling with one variable at the margins. I’m sorry, it’s scientific nonsense. And a very serious nonsense. But it’s the economics above all, because that’s the motion, the costs. I come from the left wing politically. I am fed up with environmentalists putting regressive costs and taxes on the poor. It always costs more in the end, whatever Adam and the other say, and it’s always fundamentally on the poor. They’ve forgotten the famous Jevons Paradox, Professor Jevons from my own country, University College, London, that actually when you save on energy, you don’t really save, you simply transfer it to new energy costs, and actually probably issue more CO2. So when you save energy you take another holiday, you take another flight, your CO2 increases. And he demonstrated that in the 19th century. Have we forgotten this basic economics. But above all, it’s this. I’m going to be honest about this, I don’t trust the environmentalist agenda. For 30 to 40 years, what they have fundamentally been wanting to do, is place an infinity in cost-benefit. In other words, so that the rationality of economic choices is undermined by effectively a religious choice, not an economic choice. Under an infinity of course, choice is not made under the procedures that were put down by Peter, and by Bjorn. But it won’t work. And that leads me, it becomes a closed system of thought, and that always worries me deeply. But it’s the politics then, finally, sub-prime politics. We are full of eco-poseurs and in the United States you have some gems. I don’t think I need to mention them. But what we’ve got to remember is that, this motion is about the cost of artificially in a sense, forcing down the carbon. Energy security, efficiency, are of course they’re absolutely vital. Energy security will become of the major themes…of the Obama administration, and rightly so, but that isn’t artificially forcing down carbon. And exactly as Peter said, only this week, China announced a 30 percent increase by 2015, in its coal production. Actually announced that only this week. And in a sense, we are not being realistic. As I said I would love to be able to think we can control climate, when of course it is indeed going to have to be adaptation, flexibility put to an outcome that we don’t know ‘cause I actually don’t know what climate, they’re wanting to produce for us. And actually I don’t think they know either. But let me come back to Johnson again, ‘cause Johnson said everything—Bible, Shakespeare and Johnson, you’ve got it. And Johnson said virtually everything. In a very, very brilliant book that he wrote in the 18th century there called Rasselas, he talks of an astronomer who claims that he can control climate. This is what he says. “The sun has listened to my dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction. The clouds at my call, have poured their waters.” And what does Johnson say about this astronomer—astronomer? He was mad! And so are we, if we actually believe we can control climate predictably, the costs in every sense will be enormous. Oh, mamma mia. We are the dancing queens. Let’s give this global warming nonsense, its Waterloo tonight. Thank you.",
against,"Wow. Philip, you ought to be a preacher. You ever heard a more religious proposition? Let’s bring it back to economics, I’m a professor of business at Presidio School of Management, and I teach my students to follow the money. Are major reductions in carbon worth the money. That’s what we’re debating, we’re not debating whether or not we can control the climate, we’re not even debating what the climate will be, we’re debating, are major reductions worth the money, and that’s the only question…for better or worse that we’re gonna talk about tonight. My company walked into a company that has big warehouses, about a million square feet of warehouse, and boxes stacked floor to ceiling. Every 10 feet in the ceiling were 500-watt light bulbs shining down on the tops of boxes. The guys who worked down below had task-lighting so they could see where they were going. We said, y’all have a switch? $650,000 saved the first year, now that is not a cost, to deliver major carbon reductions. Similarly we worked with another company that has left its… 630,000 computers and monitors on 24-7 because they had an urban myth that you, uh, have to leave your computers on. And we pointed out to them that, actually, IT did not need them left on 24-7. And a simple company policy that when you turn your computer off you turn it all the way off, saved them $700,000 the first year. Again, zero cost, now this is what’s called low-hanging fruit, we could half the carbon in the country. Let’s look at what we’re actually spending on carbon, this country borrows somewhere between a billion and $2 billion a day to buy oil, we borrow the money from the Chinese, and we send it to the Saudis, as Jim Woolsey who used to run the CIA, we’re fighting both sides of the war on terror, we pay for our guys and we send money to the guys who pay for the other guys, now this is daft. We know how to eliminate, at least three quarters of that oil, just through smarter technology, so now you and I and the rest of American taxpayers are gonna bail out Detroit because they failed to do this. How about we attach a little string to that money, if we’re gonna own the car companies now, let’s ask them to build the state of the art cars. Any of you ever seen a Tesla? You wanna go real fast? Yeah. We can build safer, faster, peppier, sportier, better cars, that use no energy, now, electric car, okay, you go to Google. Google recently decided that they could make all of their parking lots carports with solar on ‘em…pay back within 10 years, oh, 10 years is a long time, no it’s not. A two-year payback which is what people say they demand, is a 70 percent return on investment. You guys on Wall Street, you tell me where you can get 70 percent return on investment in today’s market. So Google put in these solar--and they have little pull-down plugs, you bring your electric car, you plug it in. My next car’s gonna be a plug-in hybrid. My friend Jim Woolsey, the ex-head of the CIA, drives a plug-in hybrid he runs on solar on his roof. Has a little bumper sticker on it, “Osama bin Laden hates my car.” Major reductions in carbon are worth the money. Chicago Climate Exchange, this is a voluntary group of now over 400 businesses, my company is a member…who have pledged to cut their carbon. They have reduced carbon…collectively 8 percent. There’s no law that says they have to, you don’t need taxes, you don’t need Draconian regulation. We simply need to be smart about how we use energy. They represent companies, 20 percent of the Dow Jones industrials, and 17 percent of stationery emissions in this country. California, AB-32, new study out from the University of California, fully implementing the Republican Governor Schwarzenegger’s cap on carbon. And trading regime…would deliver to California $78 billion, in increased state gross product. $78 billion, and 400,000 new jobs. Florida, another Republican governor, Republican task force study, that cutting carbon emissions 51 percent below the business-as-usual projections, would add $28 billion to state gross product, several hundred thousand new jobs. Arizona, even more, 60-some percent cut below now, $5 billion and 200,000 new jobs, there are now studies from 20 states, you add it up…if this country implemented aggressive climate protection measures, 500 billion in increased savings to the country, and 5 million green jobs. That’s where the 5 million green jobs number comes from. So let’s bring it home. 4 Times Square down the, down the road? Looks like a normal building, costs the same to build, uses half the energy, gets its energy from photo-voltaics in the skin of the building, and a fuel cell in the basement. This building can never be turned off. So in the 2003 northeast blackout, remember that? People came from blocks around to camp out underneath it. Genuine homeland security, if we want security, if we want an economy, we wanna have jobs in this country, we will invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Because it’s what gives us the greatest rate of return. Oh, and it also solves the climate problem, assuming there is one. But let’s assume the climate skeptics are right. Everything you would do if you were simply a profit-maximizing capitalist, is exactly what you would do if you were scared to death about climate change. A little company across the river, Voltaics. My friend Peter De Nuvila’s chair of this little company, they make the gas precursors for photo-voltaics. Because they’re selling a lotta their gases to China, they are now a net exporter—they’re making their county a net exporter to China. Again, if we want an economy, we can unleash the greatest…prosperity humanity has ever known. And Bjorn, I share your, your care for people in developing countries, where are we gonna get the money? We’re gonna get it because we’re going to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and those investments are worth the money. Thank you.",
for,"Yeah, and clearly I think any economist would say that we need to actually make sure that the externality, the thing that you don’t pay for, that you actually end up paying for it. But you also have to have a realistic sense of it, and that’s of course where we need to talk, not just about what works, and in particular, companies, but what actually works for the economy. If you look across all the different studies, and Professor Richard Tol has done so, and it’s the latest and the only global survey of all the costs of what is an extra ton of CO2 causing of damage in the world, the answer is that’s about $7 per ton of CO2. That translates pretty much into 6 cents per gallon of gasoline. So yes, we should have a carbon tax, that’s not what actually gonna do anything majorly for or against our emissions.",
against,"Well, I think that the—this whole question that, of paying for externalities associated with carbon emissions is absolutely crucial. And then, you get to the point of if people do pay for externalities in the form perhaps of a carbon tax or an auction price of carbon permits under a cap-and-trade system, what then happens to those funds that are raised. And clearly, there are two ways to go, there is adaptation, there is mitigation, but the greatest of these is mitigation. Because the best way that we can serve the victims and potential victims of climate change, is by making sure that it does not happen.",
for,Oh—,
for,"You—you’re never going to stop climate change, can we just kill one thing off. Climate will change without us or with us. And that’s where Bjorn is right. Bjorn—Bjorn is right because always it’s going to have to aid adaptation. If in any way we impoverish ourselves so we cannot help the developing world, that would indeed be a moral mistake of mammoth proportions—",
against,"Whoa, nobody’s talking about impoverishing ourselves, we are talking about the generation of wealth through smart investments. Now your question of, who’s gonna spend the money…most of the people that are proposed to spend the money, whether it be the UN or the US government or anybody’s government, I think they’re gonna spend it badly. How about we set incentives to enable the business community to do what it is already doing, which is decarbonizing, because it’s in their economic interest—",

Where you’re wrong with that, it is a necessary part but not sufficient because there are two components, there’s research-and-development, and then there is making sure that it happens on a sufficiently large scale to get the economies of mass production, which are real, and we know in the case of solar PV, that the cost falls 20 percent, for every doubling of production, we see in the New York Times today, that the cost to Americans of installing solar PV is half of what it used to be, as a result in part of these kind of cost savings—",

Yes, Yohe, and to a certain extent Tol, believe that it’s also a good idea that we invest, and remember, it is mainly investing in research and development but also investing in carbon reductions right now. There was another party, Professor Green, who made the argument that we should be investing much more in research and development and then only much later invest in cutting carbon emissions. What came out of the Copenhagen Consensus where we had eight of the world’s top economists, including five Nobel laureates, looking at all that stuff, they said, well, if you look just in carbon reductions which is what we talk about here tonight, that probably pays less than $1 back on the dollar.

I might wish to save energy and I’ve invited you all round for dinner, be very nice to meet you all for dinner, but in fact, I’m going to cook my pizzas and all the rest of it, in the shower so I’m going to save energy. Of course you’re going to end up with a very, very rotten dinner, and I think this is at the heart of what we’re discussing here, how far do— How far do dual instruments and multi-instruments actually work, and I think, it’s when I do passionately disagree with Oliver on this.

against,"Well the first— The first false choice that is placed here, is deciding that China needs to be constrained first, I mean, the greatest challenge and I—Mr. Lomborg and I would agree here, the greatest challenge that’s facing the people of China is that too many of them don’t have enough energy. They need a lot more of it. And we have a moral, a just cause, to make sure that everyone can live on the planet and there’ll be 9 billion of us by 2040, with enough energy to be able to live. So, I actually far expect our carbon emissions to increase—recession-depression notwithstanding, right now, as we try to get those people to energy parity, they live in energy deficit. And our first priority, one of the reasons I believe so much in investing right now, is because we need to create technologies that can make the case. Now, what type of constraints would be put on China, well China obviously is interested in that as well. And China as it begins to invest and succeed as Hunter mentioned in one of their entrepreneurs, in building these sort of renewable technologies, is gonna be very interested in dealing with the air pollution because in Chinese cities they’re very concerned about air pollution right now and they know that comes from coal plants and they’re concerned about dealing with that. So they’re highly motivated to, to reach the point of energy parity, a place where everyone has enough energy, and then to ratchet down both the CO2 emissions, the air particulate matter emissions, and all those sorts of negative consequences that come from it.",

And the nature of that benefit is a lot more than just the carbon. There are many, many benefits, such as air pollution. What is the world’s biggest source of arsenic and mercury in the environment? It is burning coal. What do you say to all, to the absolutely disgusting images that we see of mountaintop removal in Appalachia in order to reach coal seams? What do you think of the wars that are being waged in the Middle East where the thirst for fossil fuels and oil fundamentally underlies them? There are many benefits in moving away from that kind of world into a world which is actually characterized by cooperation on energy because if we move large scale to renewable energy it requires cooperation among countries with different kinds of intermittent renewables balancing out supplies over long distance grids.

Had we done it then we would not be having this debate now because we would not be burning carbon. Can, how do we do it? Yeah, that definitely takes some exquisite economics, planning. I’m not a big fan of Kyoto and I am on record betting the Danish Energy Minister a bottle of whiskey that COP 15 will fail, that the effort by the world to come up with a Where-do-we-go-from-Kyoto? will fail.

It was, of course, by turning coal into oil. And there are vast coal reserves.

Matt Simmons, the Houston oil banker, says we’ve already hit peak oil. And what has held it up, what held up the run-up in prices is the economic collapse. It really doesn’t matter. The investments that you would want to make if you were scared to death about peak oil are exactly the same investments you’d want to make if you simply want to make money, i.e., energy efficiency, and then renewable energy.

If we don’t do anything by 2030 it’ll be up to one point seven percent. But if we really strive, if we really do everything that all those people, over here on this side wants us to do we might be able to – the International Energy Agency estimates – to squeeze it up to two point eight percent. I’m sorry, that’s just not gonna make a big difference in this world. And that’s, of course, the real crucial point.",

against,"Someone asked the question, How far should we go? And you know, at what point have we made sufficient cuts in greenhouse gas emissions? And there is, in fact, quite a clear answer to that. What we’ve gotta do, Philip Stott is quite right when he says, We can’t stop climate change. What we’ve gotta do is to stop the runaway greenhouse effect in which positive feedback processes in the climate system lead to an inexorable extreme warming process, turning this planet into a very different place, a hothouse earth – one in which the limiting factor on humans isn’t so much whether we can survive the temperatures. It’s whether the climate system can survive these temperatures. It’s whether ice caps can survive these temperatures. And the bottom line actually came from Jim Hanson of NASA, of Columbia University, just up the road – and that is, three fifty parts per million. If we manage to have long term stabilization at three hundred and fifty parts per million of CO2 accompanied by major reductions in other greenhouse gases, we actually have a chance of preventing that runaway greenhouse effect. Now, I think it’s worth spending almost any amount of money to stop that from happening. The fantastic news is we don’t have to. Actually, the costs are really quite modest in the context of the global economy and they bring benefits, which are greater, considerably greater than what we spend. And it’s spread over a far wider area than simply economic benefits. They bring quality of life benefits, ecological benefits, benefits in food security, benefits in bio-diversity. And so to come back to the point of this – is it worth making these investments in order to bring about major cuts in carbon dioxide, in the emissions? The answer is, yes, it is. And I’m very happy to know that this is actually on the verge of taking place here in the United States under the new President, Obama.",2.0
for,"Thank you. It’s a little depressing to see that I started out telling you that we were gonna hear two arguments. And indeed we have heard them. One is that this is gonna be the end of the world and therefore we need to do whatever Oliver says. I’m not really sure that’s such a great argument. I would simply say we know from the U.N. Climate Panel that global warming will cause problems but it will not by any means be the end of the world. It is one of the many problems we need to tackle and that’s exactly why we’re having this debate -- exactly asking, Is this worth the money or should we indeed do other things? And that’s, of course, the other slightly sad thing, that it’s a false choice. We can do everything but we don’t. And so my question to you is really very, very simply, How do you want to be remembered? Al Gore actually points this out very well. He says, This is our generational mission. He asks you, How do you want to be remembered by your kids and your grandkids? I find it stunning that he would actually make that argument because the real question is, Do you want to be remembered for having spent hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now? Or do you want to be remembered for actually having solved all the major problems that half of this world’s population suffers -- these medieval, terrible tragedies that we are watching right now? This is really about how you want to be remembered. And I hope you want to be remembered by doing a lot of good rather than just a little bit. That’s what tonight’s decision is about. That’s the tradeoff. Thank you. Well, and now I am done, I am going to get personal and nasty. And I’m going to talk to you over there, and you. Yeah, you know who you are – and also you. And like a medieval priest, you know, there are carbon brokers out there today who will sell you an indulgence that will forgive all your carbon sins. It will run you about five hundred dollars for five tons of carbon, which is about what the typical American needs – or about two thousand dollars per typical household. Your broker will spend the money on something good – most likely cleaning up hog farms in Brazil. But if you really want to make a difference, you must send a check large enough to forgive four Brazilian households, too, because they can’t afford that. So to cover all five households – the rich one and the four poor – make it four thousand dollars. And you probably forgot to send a check last year and who knows?, some of you might even forget it for the next eight years. Let’s cover all the sins, you know, one backed, this year’s and eight in advance. You’ll feel so much better if you’ve already paid for these future sins. Let’s make it ten years, forty thousand dollars. Now, if you honestly believe that substantial reductions in carbon emissions are worth the money, you will, sadly, vote against the proposition. But then you must, you absolutely must, scurry right back home and send your check in because if you don’t you will have burdened your already sooty soul with an extra five tons of self-righteous hypocrisy. And you can’t possibly, you can’t possibly afford what it will take to forgive that. Your other -- Your other option, your other option is to keep your money in the pocket and vote for the proposition. However desperately you may wish it were false, vote for because it is, in fact, a true statement of engineering and economic and geo-political fact. And vote “for” because acknowledging reality is the essential first step in trying to change anything for the better.",2.0
against,"Boys, you’ve done a pretty good job of arguing what is essentially an untenable proposition. Why is it untenable? Because the numbers are in. Goldman Sachs, July two years ago, showed that the companies that are leading the way in cutting their emissions, in implementing energy efficiency have twenty-five percent higher stock value than their competitors. The Economist Intelligence Unit, last February – the companies that are leading in this have the highest, fastest growing stock value and, conversely, the worst performing companies in the economy are most likely to have nobody in charge of these issues. Deutsche Asset Management, Dr. Bruce Kahn: This is a historic opportunity for the administration to take a global leadership position in energy while addressing the current economic and financial crisis. He calls for a green national infrastructure bank investing in energy efficiency and renewables. He said, Spend on the green sweet spot -- efficiency in buildings, the new electric grid, renewables and public tranist. He said, Credible scientific debate is over. As more dynamic models of climate change are developed, we expect to see estimates of the danger of global warming increasing. This is the business community, folks. This is simply a better way of doing business. Now, you hold in your hands the future. You can choose to vote for the finest thinking of the Twentieth Century or you can vote for the future. You can vote to unleash this new energy prosperity. It matters what you vote now. We have argued – and I think we’ve proven -- that cutting carbon is worth the money. We have not tried to argue that these investments will solve everything. We have also argued – I have – that these are the investments that will deliver genuine development to the rest of the world. So if you care about Bjorn’s position you will invest in these low carbon technologies.",2.0
for,"Adam quoted a very great American. I’d like also to relate to a northeastern great American – in fact, the very founder of the American ecological movement – George Perkins Marsh of Vermont, who wrote Men and Nature in 1864, one of the greatest books ever written. And Professor David Lowenthal, also a great American author of the day, wrote something about him, which is extremely important for us to hear in the case of this debate. Environmental reformers who find nature’s inarticulate indifference unbearable impute their own aims to nature and then purport to speak on nature’s behalf. A rarified natural world is then worshiped as virtuous. And Marsh himself said, The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve. I think there was a mighty humility in Marsh’s view of nature, which actually we’ve forgotten today, which is vital. ‘Cause what I am interested in is outcomes. Will it work? Remember the motion is major cuts. I’m really serious about this. We agree on the influence that climate change will have impacts on people. Of course it will. But what is really in the end going to work? It’s got to work. That’s why Peter’s realism is absolutely essential to all this. And back to Johnson to end. He said, Why, sir, most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things, he said – which I think is an important way of always looking at it. But finally, the limits of all that we’re doing here – also Johnson. How small of all that human hearts endure that part which laws or kings or senates or congresses – I’ve added those -- can cause or cure. In the end we want to solve this because we think it’s us. I’m afraid it’s nature, greater than us, and we can’t in the end manage it as we wish we would. Thank you.",2.0
